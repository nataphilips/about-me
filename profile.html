            <p>My name is Natalia Filippova and I am from Moscow. </p>

            <p>In 2011 I graduated from National Research University of Electronic Technology (diploma of a Specialist in Marketing) and started working in an advertising agency. I've been working there for 6 years.
              Then I moved out from Moscow and started traveling, and this was the time I got inspired from my programmer friends to change my profession to tech field. </p>

            <p>I've been studying systematically since March 2019, before that I just did a few videos and small challenges.By this time I got through Front End course on Udemy, several katas and some personal exercise projects. During these month I focused mostly on React as this framework is in high demand and is actually very convenient.
              Even though I studied a lot by myself, I'm missing working in a team or a mentor's feedback. A friend told me about this bootcamp, and this is why I started applying to participate.</p>
